# Comic Book Archive explorer
This is small application to read comic book files (.cbz for a start) and provide a nice and simple UI to enjoy them.

# Background
The point of this project it primarily for me to learn. Below are some of the reason and the point which I'll try to overcome in this project. 
- Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) seems to be the future of web applications
- Frontend, as primarily backend developer I seldom touch anything close to frontend. This will change now.
- Test out GraphQL instead of REST
- Create docker container of the application
- Create Flake to be used in Nix

# Stack
The idea is to create a FastAPI stack similar to [full-stack-fastapi-template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template).

# Roadmap
TBA
